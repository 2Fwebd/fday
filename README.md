## Help
### Where do I set my email regarding the form ?
Regarding the contact form we just need your email so write it into the file **Sending.php** line 8. 								
Then you will receive all the emails from your website. 

### Where do I set the date for the countdown ?
You have to open the file **"Custom.js"** in "js" folder, you can see in the beginning of the files all the informations to set up the countdown.

### Why I don't receive any email ?
Common Issues :

*   You're not redirected on another page:

    *   Check if sending.php is in your server, then be sure you made no change in the form's tags

*   You see a warning of success but you receive nothing:

    *   Check if your provider accepted the sending of emails
    *   Check if your email is correctly set in sending.php line 8
    *   Check your mailbox again...

### Where can I find the icons library ?
Well this template use Font Awesome, so you can take a look to all the icons available here -> 
[Library](fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)

### How do I set my logo ?
Just replace logo.png in the folder "images" with your own, easy !
